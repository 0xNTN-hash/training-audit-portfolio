# Securety | Smart Contract Auditor Portfolio 🔒

Hey! I’m on a mission to become a skilled **Web3 smart contract auditor**, blending my background in web development with a deep focus on blockchain security. This repo is my living portfolio where I document everything I’m learning and building—hands-on audits, tools, challenges, and resources.

---

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a self-taught blockchain developer transitioning from full-stack web dev to smart contract security auditing. I’m currently learning through real-world challenges via the **Cyfrin Updraft** program and exploring audit platforms like **CodeHawks**.

I’m especially drawn to:
- 🛡️ **Smart contract vulnerabilities** and defense strategies  
- 📉 **Gas optimizations** for cost-efficient contracts  
- 🧩 The design and audit of **DeFi and NFT protocols**  
- 🔍 Developing a security-first mindset

## 🛠 Current Focus

### 📘 Technical Skills in Progress
- Spotting vulnerabilities: `reentrancy`, `unchecked external calls`, `access control`, etc.  
- Auditing contracts with **Slither**, **Foundry**, and **Echidna**  
- Mastering secure design patterns in Solidity  
- Building isolated environments using **Docker** for safe testing  

### 💻 Hands-On Work
- Refactoring and breaking smart contracts intentionally to understand exploits  
- Writing tests that simulate malicious actors  
- Reviewing and annotating audit reports to improve critical thinking  
- Participating in mock audits and capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges

## 📁 Portfolio Projects

- `CryptoLotto`: A smart contract lottery dApp built from scratch with Chainlink VRF, refactored for gas efficiency and multi-ticket support  
- `Updraft Labs`: Challenges and notes from the Cyfrin Updraft program  
- `Audit Reports`: My writeups and simulations of vulnerabilities found in mock projects  

> More repos and writeups coming soon...

## 🚀 What’s Next?

I’m preparing for my **first audit competition and bounty**—the goal is to start earning by contributing to real-world security reviews. I’ll be sharing progress in public as part of the `#BuildInPublic` and `#100DaysOfAuditing` challenge.  

Feel free to follow my journey or reach out if you're also into Web3 security!
